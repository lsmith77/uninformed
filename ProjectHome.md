The [ResolutionFinder.org](http://resolutionfinder.org) application is a database concept which was developed across four thematic issues chosen from the UN agenda. These four thematic issues are:

  * clean drinking water
  * women and education
  * malaria
  * small arms and light weapons

After testing the viability of our search options and filters, we will expand the content of ResolutionFinder.org to include further issues. Our long-term goal is to ultimately cover all thematic areas of the UN and contain information on several tens of thousands of different documents.

A prototype of the application was created in fall 2009, we have been working on a first public version of the application since January 2010, which was [released](http://search.un-informed.org) as a first beta on May 20th in Geneva. Its based on [symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/) 1.4 using [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) 1.2 to access a MySQL database and using the [sfSolrPlugin](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfSolrPlugin) to communicate with Solr. The next major launch in December 2010 added search by documents and a much improved search UI.

The [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/uninformed/wiki/Introduction) is currently a bit outdated. We are definitely still looking for people to help in development!
