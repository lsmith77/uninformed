#summary The first major redesign of the search interface, making it more compact

= Search UI Redesign =

Must have:
 * The dedicated search by code field on the front page disappears and instead the search field is moved into the main form and extended to always also suggest prefix search
 * The radio field to decide if all or any of the tags disappears (only "all tags" from now on supported)
 * The labels are moved into the input fields (shown as grey text that disappears when one clicks into the field)
 * In the tags field when a tag is selected its added as a "separate bubble" into the tags field (see http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/autosuggest-jquery-plugin)
 * On the search result page the input fields are shown at the top, allowing the filters to be moved up
 * In the filters we should for each filter type show at most 5 (configurable for each type) number of filters with a show more to show the rest
 * There is quote-aware autosuggest inside the fulltext search field
 * There is a button to enable help-mode and only in this help mode the ? buttons are shown with links to the help page opening in a new window

Nice to have
 * There are two search buttons: "Search for Clauses" and "Search for Documents"
 * "Search for Documents"
    * Shows the results grouped by Documents
    * Clause content is shown folded if there is nothing highlighted in the content
 * Clause content is reduced to only show with sections containing highlighted text
 * Add a button to generate a short link for the current search results
