<h3><a href="#">What is ResolutionFinder.org?</a></h3>
<div>
    <p>The ResolutionFinder.org application is a database concept which was developed across four thematic issues chosen
    from the UN agenda. These four thematic issues are:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>clean drinking water</li>
        <li>women and education</li>
        <li>malaria</li>
        <li>small arms and light weapons</li>
    </ol>

    <p>After testing the viability of our search options and filters, we will expand the
    content of ResolutionFinder.org to include further issues. Our long-term goal is to ultimately cover all thematic
    areas of the UN and contain information on several tens of thousands of different documents.</p>
