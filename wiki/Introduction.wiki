= Introduction =

We currently have a reference implementation for the backend in the [http://code.google.com/p/uninformed/source/browse/#svn/branches/backend-prototype backend-prototype branch] that will not be developed further. Based on this reference implementation we have discussed the concept of a final version of the backend scheduled for March 2010. Since we are not sure yet about how many development resources we have available there is a plan A and plan B in order to be able to provide a fully working solution either way:

 * Plan A: In plan A the idea is that all data entry will be done via the backend web interface. There will be a way to import excel sheets solely for the purpose of being able to import legacy data files.
 * Plan B: In plan B the idea is that all data entry will be done via the backend web interface that cannot be done via the excel sheet format in a sensible way.

The following specification just details the functional delta between the current backend prototype and the final planned version. All features which are required for plan B will be noted as such.

== General requirements ==

It needs to be possible to define what admintools are accessible to what user groups. Further certain actions within admintools also need to be restrict-able (For example setting a Document to status active should be limited to certain users). Ideally there would be a versioned history of all entities. Ideally there would also be some support tools/filters to aid the editorial process like being able to see a list of items that need review, seeing all items which were created/modified by someone specific etc.
