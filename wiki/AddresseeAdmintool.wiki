= Introduction =

Simple admintool to manage names of addressees.

= Details =

 * List of all existing addressees with edit/delete buttons along with a count of how often the addressee is currently used
 * Search filters with livesearch clauses/documents
 * A separate "quick jump" livesearch form to directly jump to the edit page of that addressee entry
 * Button to create a new addressee
 * In the edit panel consider adding a tool to migrate/delete the addressee setting of clauses to an another/new addressee (needs to also work when we have a large number of clauses).
